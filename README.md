# Nav_Powershell
Powershell scripts used to aid in administration of Dynamics Nav 2016

I'm still working out ways to control Dynamics Nav 2016 with Powershell this could cause some of these scripts to not function in your enviroment. All scripts are written for use against Powershell 5.0
I am using PDQDeploy to install Dynamics Nav 2016 and place the icon. I may rewrite this to use a CSV file of computer names in the near future.
